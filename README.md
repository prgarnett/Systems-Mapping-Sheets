# Systems Mapping Sheets

Presented here are the strcutured spreadsheets that can either used alone to capture network structure, or then combine with the software tools to produce a variety of network outputs (e.g. Neo4J databases, GraphViz files, etc).

The spreadsheets have two versions, one for the collection of information about nodes and the other for the collection of relationship data. They are separated this way as it allows for easier collection of attributes (both node and edge attritubes) and one to many relationships (where one node connects to many other nodes).

It should be noted that any attribute containing the string `dateâ€™ within it will be treated as a date object and therefore should follow the date pattern YYYY-MM-DD. The program also expects that the first line of the file is the header information; do not deviate from the header column names

## The nodes sheet
As a minimum nodes must have a type and one attribute which uniquely identifies that node, they can then have any number of further attributes. The structure of the nodes sheet can be seen in file Nodes.png, and a CSV version should be available as well.

As shown in image the nodes sheet is relatively simple. The first column records the note type (we will add notes on how to choose types etc later), the second column records the label of the first attribute, and the third column the value of that attribute. The rest of the columns record pairs of attributes, label name and value, and can be expanded to accommodate any number of attributes. One attribute needs to uniquely identify the node, and we recommend that this be recorded first as in many cases that might be the only attribute. Think of this as a the unique ID of the node, it can be a String label (but make sure you are perfectly consistent) or a number etc. It should be noted that not all output formats support attributes on nodes in the same way.

## The relationship sheet
The relationship sheet is similar but slightly more complicated. Relationships at a minimum need to have the type of the two nodes defined (node_type_1 and node_type_2), a match key for each node (the attribute label of the unique attribute of the nodes you are matching on, match_key_1 and match_key_2), and the corresponding match id (the value associated with the label of the unique attribute of the nodes, match_id_1 and match_id_2), and the relationship type (re_type). These pieces of information uniquely identify the two nodes included in the relationship, and the type of relationship to be formed, and are stored first in the table. All further attributes are handled in the same way as for nodes, pairs of attribute labels and values and you can have as many as you want. It should be noted that not all output formats support attributes on relationships in the same way.
